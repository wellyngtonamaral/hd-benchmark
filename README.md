# hd-benchmark

This repository contains a collection of simple Linux command lines to perform benchmarks of spinning disks.

The available scripts are:

**hd-benchmark-iops.sh** runs performance tests directly on the physical device, abstracting the operating system and file system aspects.

Using this, it is possible to find out the disk's speed and the performance of the disk interface/disk controller (e.g., PCIe SATA Controller or Port Multiplier).

In the end, you can summarize all results in a single CSV file and compare multiple disks.

**hd-benchmark-throughput.sh** - it runs tests file system and/or a disk array.

> [!CAUTION]
> These scripts can cause irreparable damage to the file system if you select devices in use.

## Pre-requisites

To run the test is needed to have the FIO installed.

```shell
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get install fio
```


## Setup

Before running the test, it is necessary to define the variables:

to **hd-benchmark-iops.sh**:

| Variable | Description | Value(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DEV    | Defines which devices will be tested                                                    |  /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd /dev/sde /dev/sdf   |
| BS     | Defines which block sizes will be tested                                                | 4k 16k 256k 1m                                  |
| OP     | Defines which operations will be tested                                                 | randread randwrite randrw read write readwrite  |
| RT     | Defines how long (in seconds) each test will take                                       | 300                                             |
| HEADER | Defines the headers to the CSV output file, it follows the FIO --minimal specification  | Do not change!                                  |

to **hd-benchmark-throughput.sh**:

| Variable | Description | Value(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MNT    | Defines which devices will be tested                                                    |  /mnt/mount-point   |
| BS     | Defines which block sizes will be tested                                                | 4k 16k 256k 1m                                  |
| GB     | Defines which file size will be tested                                                  | 100GB                                  |
| OP     | Defines which operations will be tested                                                 | randread randwrite randrw read write readwrite  |
| RT     | Defines how long (in seconds) each test will take                                       | 300                                             |
| HEADER | Defines the headers to the CSV output file, it follows the FIO --minimal specification  | Do not change!                                  |
